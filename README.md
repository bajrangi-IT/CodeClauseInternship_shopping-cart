# Shopping Cart Demo — CodeClause Internship Project

A simple e-commerce-style product catalog & shopping cart implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎯 Project Overview  
This is a minimal web application that lets users:
- Browse a catalog of products  
- Add products to a shopping cart  
- Adjust quantity or remove items  
- View the total price dynamically  

The goal is to demonstrate basic e-commerce functionalities — perfect for learning or small-scale demo use.

## 🧰 Technologies Used  
- HTML (for layout & structure)  
- CSS (for styling / responsive UI)  
- JavaScript (for dynamic rendering & cart management)  

## 📁 Repository Structure  
/ (root)
│── index.html → main HTML file
│── style.css → CSS styling
│── script.js → JavaScript logic (product listing, cart, total cost, etc.)

## 🚀 How to Run Locally  
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP.  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.  
3. Browse products, add to cart, update quantities — cart updates live.  

> ⚠️ No backend or server required — purely frontend.  

## 🎯 What You Can Learn / What It Demonstrates  
- Dynamic rendering of product listings via JavaScript  
- Cart state management (add/remove/update)  
- Dynamic price & total calculation  
- Basic UI / UX for an e-commerce-style interface  

## 💡 Future Improvements (Optional Enhancements)  
- Add product data via JSON file or API  
- Use a JavaScript framework/library (React / Angular / Vue) for scalable UI  
- Persist cart state (e.g. using LocalStorage)  
- Add product detail views, search/filter, sorting  
- Add checkout flow / payment UI (just simulation)

🎨 Why This Structure Helps
It immediately informs visitors what the project is for (what problem it solves, what features it has). This “what/how/why” approach is a best practice for README files.

+1

It describes how to run the project — without that, someone would have to dig through files to guess.

It outlines the project structure, which helps collaborators or future you to navigate the codebase quickly.

It highlights learnings / scope for extension, giving both context and room for improvements.

It invites contributors/collaborators, which is useful especially if you share publicly.
